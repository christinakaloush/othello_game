The program starts the game with the following board configuration. In our program, the board size can be 4x4 or 6x6 or 8x8. 

##Additional Rules
• Players take alternate turns.
• A player is only allowed to make valid moves. A valid move is one where at least one disc of the
opponent is reversed.
• If a player cannot make a valid move, then that player loses his/her turn.
• The game ends when neither player can move or when the board is full.
• The player with the most pieces (discs) on the board at the end wins the game, if there is no tie.
